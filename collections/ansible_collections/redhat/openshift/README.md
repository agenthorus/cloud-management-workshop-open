# OpenShift Collection for Ansible

This repo hosts the `redhat.openshift` Ansible Collection.

## Description
The collection includes a variety of Ansible content to help automate the management of applications in OpenShift clusters, as well as the provisioning and maintenance of clusters themselves.


## Installation

### Installing the Collection from Automation Hub

Before using the OpenShift collection, you need to install it with the Automation Hub CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.openshift

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: redhat.openshift
    version: 4.0.2
```

### Installing the Kubernetes Python Library

Content in this collection requires the [Kubernetes Python client](https://pypi.org/project/kubernetes/) to interact with Kubernetes' APIs. You can install it with:

    pip3 install kubernetes

## Use Cases

### Using modules from the OpenShift Collection in your playbooks

It's preferable to use content in this collection using their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), for example `redhat.openshift.openshift`:

```yaml
---
plugin: redhat.openshift.openshift
connections:
  - namespaces:
    - testing
```

For documentation on how to use individual plugins included in this collection, please see the links in the 'Included content' section earlier in this README.

### Ansible Turbo mode Tech Preview

The `redhat.openshift` collection supports Ansible Turbo mode as a tech preview via the `cloud.common` collection. By default, this feature is disabled. To enable Turbo mode, set the environment variable `ENABLE_TURBO_MODE=1` on the managed node. For example:

```yaml
---
- hosts: remote
  environment:
    ENABLE_TURBO_MODE: 1
  tasks:
    ...
```

Please read more about Ansible Turbo mode - [here](https://github.com/ansible-collections/redhat.openshift/blob/main/docs/ansible_turbo_mode.rst).
