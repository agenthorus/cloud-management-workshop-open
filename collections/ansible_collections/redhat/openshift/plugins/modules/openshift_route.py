- Looks up a Service and creates a new Route based on it.
- Analogous to `oc expose` and `oc create route` for creating Routes, but does not
  support creating Services.
- For creating Services from other resources, see kubernetes.core.k8s.
module: openshift_route
notes:
- To avoid SSL certificate validation errors when C(validate_certs) is I(True), the
  full certificate chain for the API server must be provided via C(ca_cert) or in
  the kubeconfig file.

      19.15.0, it fails even no_proxy set in correct.
    - example value is "localhost,.local,.example.com,127.0.0.1,127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16"

  persist_config:
    description:
    - Whether or not to save the kube config refresh tokens. Can also be specified
      via K8S_AUTH_PERSIST_CONFIG environment variable.
    - When the k8s context is using a user credentials with refresh tokens (like oidc
      or gke/gcloud auth), the token is refreshed by the k8s python client library
      but not saved by default. So the old refresh token can expire and the next auth
      might fail. Setting this flag to true will tell the k8s python client to save
      the new refresh token to the kube config file.
    - Default to false.
    - Please note that the current version of the k8s python client library does not
      support setting this flag to True yet.
